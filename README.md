# Lambda Framework Examples

In this project you can find examples of the Lambda Framework usage.

## Project structure

- `src`: source files writing in typescript. Each example is in a folder inside this one.
- `dist`: this folder is generated when the compilation is run. It contains the compiled files.
- `template.yaml`: the SAM template file. It's needed to run AWS Lambda functions locally.
- `src/example/README.md`: inside each example folder, there is a README file explaining the intention of it.

##Â Scripts

- `npm test`: There is no tests, so test script only check the lint rules.
- `npm compile`: It compiles the source files into the folder *dist*.

## How to run it locally?

First of all, you need compile it with the previously referred command.
